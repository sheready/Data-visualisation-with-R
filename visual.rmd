## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Data visualisation
#using the mpg dataframe
ggplot2::mpg
view(mpg)

#to know more about the mpg
?mpg

#creating a ggplot
#ggplot2 is the package while ggplot() is the function
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

#To plot mpg, run this code to put displ on the x-axis and #hwy on the y-axis:
#Code breakdown:ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph.
#The function geom_point() adds a layer of points to your #plot, which creates a scatterplot.Each geom function in #ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables #in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The mapping #argument is always paired with aes(), and the x and y #arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x #and y axes.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#conclusion:The plot shows a negative relationship between #engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy).I.e cars with #big engines use more fuel.

#Exercise
#Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
#How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
#What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg #to find out.
#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
#What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

#Aesthetic mappings
#An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your #plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or #the color of your points
#You can convey information about your data by mapping the #aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. 
#Let's map the colors of your points to the class variable to #reveal the class of each car.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

#To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of #the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside aes(). #ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the #aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of #the variable, a process known as scaling. ggplot2 will #also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to #which values.
#In the previous example, we mapped class to the color #aesthetic, but we could have mapped class to the size #aesthetic in the same way.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

#Note that we get a warning,because,mapping an unordered #variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a #good idea.

#we could have mapped class to the alpha aesthetic, which #controls the transparency of the points.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

#we can also map class to the shape aesthetic, which controls the shape of the points.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

#Note:ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups #will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.Thus the missing SUVs.
#Note:ggplot selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and it #constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values.
#It is possible to set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For #example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

#From that plot we note that, the color doesn’t convey #information about a variable, but only changes the #appearance of the plot.
#To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as #an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes outside of #aes(). You’ll need to pick a level that makes sense for that #aesthetic:
#The name of a color as a character string.
#The size of a point in mm.
#The shape of a point as a number,as shown in this link;
#use this link https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e28a1b57b6622cf67fd8a7e01c6a9955914f8fe9/635be/visualize_files/figure-html/shapes-1.png
#Note:when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the + in the #wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the #start.

#Facets
#As done above we have seen that one way of adding additional variables is with aesthetics. 
#Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, #is to split your plot into facets, subplots that each #display one subset of the data.
#To facet your plot by a single variable, use facet_wrap(). 
#The first argument of facet_wrap() should be a formula, #which you create with ~ followed by a variable name.
#(here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a #synonym for “equation”). The variable that you pass to #facet_wrap() should be discrete.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

#To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add facet_grid() to #your plot call. The first argument of facet_grid() is also a formula. This #time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a ~.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

#Geometric objects
#A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on.
#To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to ggplot(). For example;
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument.However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. On the other hand, you could set the linetype of a line. geom_smooth() will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))

#codebreakdown:geom_smooth() separates the cars into three lines based on their drv value,which describes a car’s drivetrain.To learn more about any single geom, use help: ?geom_smooth.ggplot2 provides over 40 geoms here is a link https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/ also a ggplot2 cheetsheet http://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets.
#To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to ggplot():
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
#This, however, introduces some duplication in our code.You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of mappings to ggplot(). ggplot2 will treat these mappings as global mappings that apply to each geom in the graph.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
#If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()

#Statistical Transformations
#Using the diamonds dataset.
#lets create a barchart using the goem_bar() to show that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts.
ggplot2::diamonds
view(diamonds)
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

#On the x-axis, the chart displays cut, a variable from diamonds. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in diamonds! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:
#bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.
#smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.
#boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.
#The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a stat, short for statistical transformation.How does it work , https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/70a3b18a1128c785d8676a48c005ee9b6a23cc00/7283c/images/visualization-stat-bar.png 

# the default value for stat is “count”, which means that geom_bar() uses stat_count().You can generally use geoms and stats interchangeably. For example, you can recreate the previous plot using stat_count() instead of geom_bar():

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))

#This works because every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation.
#There are three reasons you might need to use a stat explicitly:
#You might want to override the default stat.
#Let's change stat of geom_bar() from count (the default) to identity.This lets us map the height of the bars to the raw values of a y variable.

demo <- df(
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551
)
ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), stat ="identity")

#You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportion, rather than count:
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), group = 1))
#You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code. For example, you might use stat_summary(), which summarises the y values for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you’re computing:

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )

#ggplot2 provides over 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. ?stat_bin. To see a complete list of stats
?stat_bin

#Positon adjustments
#You can colour a bar chart using either the colour aesthetic, or, more usefully, fill.
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = cut))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))

#Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like clarity: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of cut and clarity

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))

#The stacking is performed automatically by the position adjustment specified by the position argument. If you don’t want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: "identity", "dodge" or "fill".
#position = "identity" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph.
#This is not very useful for bars, because it overlaps them. To see that overlapping we either need to make the bars slightly transparent by setting alpha to a small value, or completely transparent by setting fill = NA.

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "identity")
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")

#The identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d geoms, like points, where it is the default.
#position = "fill" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")

#position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")

#The values of hwy and displ are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is known as overplotting. This arrangement makes it hard to see where the mass of the data is.
#You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to “jitter”. position = "jitter" adds a small amount of random noise to each point.This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to receive the same amount of random noise.


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")

#ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for geom_point(position = "jitter"): geom_jitter().
#Coordinate systems
#The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.
#coord_flip() switches the x and y axes.For example, if you want horizontal boxplots or for long labels and it’s hard to get them to fit without overlapping on the x-axis.

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()

#coord_quickmap() sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps. This is very important if you’re plotting spatial data with ggplot2.
install.packages("maps")
install.packages("ggmap")
library(maps)
library(ggmap)
nz <- map_data("nz")

ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black")

ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()
  
#coord_polar() uses polar coordinates. Polar coordinates reveal an interesting connection between a bar chart and a Coxcomb chart.
bar <- ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), 
    show.legend = FALSE,
    width = 1
  ) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

bar + coord_flip()
bar + coord_polar()

#Data transformation
#we’re going to focus on how to use the dplyr package.We will also use data from the nycflights13 package, and use ggplot2 to help us understand the data.
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

#Note of the conflicts message that’s printed when we load the tidyverse. It tells us that dplyr overwrites some functions in base R. If we want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, we’ll need to use their full names e.g: stats::filter() and stats::lag().
stats::filter()

#To explore the basic data manipulation verbs of dplyr, we’ll use nycflights13::flights.
?flights

#To print a tibble we will use the command below.Tibbles are data frames, but slightly tweaked to work better in the tidyverse.It only shows the first few rows and all the columns that fit on one screen.
flights

#To see the whole dataset, you can run View(flights)
view(flights)

#These describe the type of each variable in the tibble:
#int stands for integers.
#dbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.
#chr stands for character vectors, or strings.
#dttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).
#Others are:
#lgl stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.
#fctr stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables with fixed possible values.
#date stands for dates.

#dplyr basics
#The five key dplyr functions that allow us to solve the vast majority of our data manipulation challenges.
#Pick observations by their values (filter()).
#Reorder the rows (arrange()).
#Pick variables by their names (select()).
#Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
#Collapse many values down to a single summary(summarise()).
#These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.

#Filter rows with filter()
#filter() allows us to subset observations based on their values. The first argument is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame.

#we can select all flights on January 1st with
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)

#to save the result, you’ll need to use the assignment operator.

jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
jan1
